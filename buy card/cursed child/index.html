        <h1>Novel Harry Potter and The Cursed Child</h1>

        <p>
          The eighth tale, after 19 years... Being Harry Potter has never been easy, and it doesn't get any better now that he is a spouse, a parent of three school-age kids, and an overworked Ministry of Magic employee. Albus, Harry's youngest son, must contend with the burden of a family heritage he never desired as his father struggles with a past that won't remain where it belongs. Both father and son discover the unsettling truth that darkness can occasionally appear out of the blue when the past and present ominously meld together.</p>
